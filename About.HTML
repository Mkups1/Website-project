        <h3>The Subathon</h3>

        <p>From March 14 2021 to april 13 2021, Ludwig Ahgren held a widely publicized "subathon" event, where every time someone subscribed to his twitch channel, it would add ten seconds to a timer. Ahgren was live for 31-days straight, after he had predicted a 48-hour stream. There were moments of hope, where the timer reached <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIMNX71D18" target="_blank"> one second</a>, and other moments of despair, with the timer at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCv-eUQYB-s" target="_blank">70+ hours</a>. He streamed a wide variety of content during the month long stream, with subjects ranging from him working out, to him sleeping every night. Ludwig promised an uncapped subathon, which meant it would go on forever, however he realized that this would become a problem.  How twitch works, is that once you subscribe to someone, your subscription lasts for one month, and then you can subscribe again.  Because of this, Ludwig was forced to put a 30-day cap on his subathon, otherwise, the subathon would have most likely gone on forever. At the start of the subathon, Ludwig had around 30,000 subscribers, and by the end, he was at 283,061 which gave him the record for highest all-time concurrent subsciber count on the site, beating Ninja's previous record of 269,154 in 2018. </p>
